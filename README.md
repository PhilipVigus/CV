I am a driven, dedicated full-stack developer with a degree in Computer Science and a hunger to learn. I spent much of my early career working in education, initially as an ICT teacher before moving into quality assurance, where I worked with organisations across London to improve their educational provision.

I am looking for a change of direction and am returning to my roots in technology. I love the creative side of development. Being able to see a website or app grow in front of me excites me, and I have recently completed Makers Academy to prepare myself for a career in software development.

## Skills

### Technical

- Languages - Javascript, Ruby, SQL, CSS, HTML
- Frameworks - React, Express, Rails, Sinatra
- Databases - PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Workflow - Git, Github, Travis CI/CD, Heroku, VSCode
- Testing - Jest, Jasmine, RSpec, Capybara, React Testing Library
- Operating Systems - Ubuntu, Mac, Windows
- Methodologies - OOP, MVC, TDD/BDD, Agile/Scrum/XP

### Non-technical

#### Communication

I excel with verbal and written communication, and am able to break complex concepts down into easy to digest chunks so they can be more easily discussed and understood.

- At Makers Academy I received regular positive feedback about the way I communicated during group projects and in pair programming. I am passionate about ensuring everyone gets a say in the direction a project takes, and take pride in my ability to facilitate this
- At OCN London I often had to communicate difficult feedback to clients while maintaining strong and constructive working relationships. I sat in rooms full of hostile teachers, explaining why the courses they had spent the last year delivering were so poor that their learners could not yet receive their certificates. I then had to work with the same staff to improve their provision and ensure learners were able to progress

#### Determination and persistence

I don't know when or how to give up.

- During the final project at Makers Academy the group had huge difficulty working out how to test the WebSocket-based components of the code. We spent hours on it without success. I refused to give up, and finally managed to write a successful test on the morning of the last day of the project
- I spent 4 years unable to work due to ill health. Recovery was a long, difficult path with plenty of obstacles, but I never once thought that I would not be able to make it back to full time employment

#### An excellent understanding of how learning works

This helps me to learn quickly, independently and effectively, and allows me to facilitate the learning of those around me.

- Before starting at Makers Academy I taught myself to build and deploy a full-stack project using Express, MongoDB and the PUG templating language. The result of this is my [Trailers](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/trailers-express) project
- At Makers Academy
  - I taught myself React alongside the regular curriculum areas
  - I was regularly given extremely positive feedback by team members and pair partners on how well I was able to facilitate their learning without spoonfeeding them solutions
  - I mentored two members of a later cohort, helping them get the most out of the course by offering technical and pastoral advice and guidance based on my experience
- While recovering from ill-health I taught myself to compose and synthesize classical music

#### Leadership

I have strong leadership skills.

- At Makers Academy I often took leadership roles during critical times in projects. I led our final project for the first couple of days, establishing solid foundations such as a team charter, consensus on the details of the project, and broadly what the two weeks of the project would look like. Every time I led I received unanimous positive feedback on my ability to keep groups focused and on task, ensure that all team members felt they had a voice, and help the team reach consensus when there were disagreements
- At OCN London I regularly led teams of moderators when visiting my clients. I was responsible for coordinating their efforts and ensuring that work got done to extremely tight schedules in challenging and occasionally unfriendly environments
