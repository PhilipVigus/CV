I am a driven, dedicated full-stack developer who loves to learn new things. I have spent the majority of my career working in education, initially as a teacher, before working in quality assurance where I worked with organisations across London to improve the quality of the courses they delivered. I am now looking for a change of direction, and with a degree in Computer Science, I am returning to my roots. I love the creative side of technology, being able to see a website or app growing in front of your eyes, and I want to be part of that process.

## Skills

**Communication skills**

I have excellent verbal and written communication skills. As a teacher I was able to break down problems into easy to digest chunks and communicate them effectively to learners to help their understanding. As a Quality Reviewer for OCN London I wrote detailed reports on the centres and courses I worked with that were sometimes critical of their working practices. I was able to communicate these difficult messages face-to-face and in writing, while maintaining strong and constructive working relationships with my clients. At Aspire I worked with clients over the telephone. They were often distressed, and I was able to help them explain their needs to us so we could assist them.

**Attention to detail**

While working as an audio transcriber and captioner, I had to follow a detailed set of guidelines that allowed me to produce accurate work quickly and consistently. At OCN London I proofread all reports before they were sent out to centres, ensuring that mistakes and inconsistencies were identified. At Aspire, the case notes I kept for clients were often used as evidence in legal proceedings, and had to be extremely accurate. At Noah's Ark Children's Hospice I compiled lists of potential leads for the fundraising team to follow up. This required working my way through hundreds of websites, establishing which organisations and individuals might be willing to donate to the charity, and I was directly responsible for identifying sources of thousands of pounds of donations.

**Quick and effective learner**

 While working at Aspire I provided cover for an absent colleague and was able to get quickly become an effective part of the team. As a result I won employee of the month in my first month of employment, despite having never worked in the sector before. At Noah's Ark Children's Hospice I had to be extremely adaptable, as I was given a wide variety of tasks across a number of roles including reception and the fundraising, marketing and care teams. I have also taught myself a number of skills in my own time, including programming with Javascript, CSS and HTML, and how to compose and synthesize classical music using a digital audio workstation.
