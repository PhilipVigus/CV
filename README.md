I am a driven, dedicated developer with a degree in Computer Science and a hunger to learn. I initially worked in technology, but my career choices took me towards more client-facing roles. I then moved into education, initially as an ICT teacher before taking a role in educational quality assurance, where I worked with organisations across London to improve their educational provision.

I have now changed direction, returning to my roots in technology. I recently completed the bootcamp at Maker's Academy to prepare myself for a career in software development. I love solving complex problems, and the blend of creative and technological skills required to build an application really excites me. I enjoy developing React user interfaces as much as designing databases and building RESTful APIs, and am currently seeking a full stack role.

### Non-technical

#### Problem-solving

I have a thorough, methodical approach to solving problems.
- For example, in my most recent [Weather](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/weather-app) project, I had problems with the initial load time and general responsiveness of the front end. I started by making sure I fully understood the problem, researching guidelines on expected website load times as well as other possible issues. Using the diagnostic tools available in Chrome, I confirmed the issue related to the size of a specific file and set about working on a solution.

  Rather than go with the first idea I had, I identified and modelled a number of approaches, each with their own pros and cons. These ranged from the most complex solution of implementing a database to hold the data, through to breaking the data down into sub-files and writing a simple server to serve these individually. I implemented a very cut-down version of the latter solution to check whether it was valid and found it was sufficient for my needs. This avoided having to spend time on the more complex and time-intensive approach completely, as I already knew it was unnecessary. 

  Lastly, I used TDD to help break the implementation of the chosen solution down into the smallest possible steps, completing it quickly and efficiently. In this particular case, my approach also helped identify a number of issues and edge cases with data the API was sending me that I was able to resolve before they became real problems.

#### An excellent understanding of how learning works

I have a superb understanding of how learning works from my training as a teacher. I learn quickly and efficiently, and excel at facilitating the learning of others.

- Before starting at Maker's Academy I created a [Trailers](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/trailers-express) website, teaching myself to build and deploy a full stack project using Express, MongoDB and the PUG templating language.
- At Maker's Academy
  - I taught myself React alongside the standard curriculum.
  - I was regularly given extremely positive feedback by team members and pair partners on how well I facilitated their learning without spoonfeeding them solutions.
  - I mentored two members of a later cohort, helping them get the most out of the course by offering technical and pastoral advice based on my experience.

#### Communication

I excel with verbal and written communication, and am able to break complex concepts down into small chunks so they can be easily discussed and understood.

- At Maker's Academy I received regular positive feedback about the way I communicated during group projects and in pair programming. I am passionate about ensuring everyone gets a say in the direction a project takes, and take pride in my ability to facilitate this.
- At OCN London I sometimes had to communicate difficult feedback to clients while maintaining strong and constructive working relationships. For example, explaining to hostile teachers why their courses were so poor that their learners could not yet receive their certificates. I then had to work with the same staff to improve their provision and ensure learners were able to progress.

#### High emotional intelligence

I am extremely self-aware and am able to empathize effectively with others.
- At the end of one project at Maker's Academy, there was a split in the group. One side was focused on getting as much done as possible, with one person adding a lot of code that others did not understand. The other side was more interested in ensuring that the work represented the entire group. I identified this problem quickly and helped the group reach a compromise that everyone was happy with.
- I give constructive, critical feedback when pair programming in a non-threatening and helpful way.
- I quickly identify when I make mistakes and am very receptive to feedback on how to improve.

#### Leadership

I have strong leadership skills.

- At Maker's Academy I often took leadership roles during critical times and received unanimous positive feedback on my ability to keep groups on task, ensure that all team members had a voice, and help the team reach consensus when there were disagreements. I led our final project for the first couple of days, establishing solid foundations such as a team charter, consensus on the details of the project, and broadly what the two weeks of the project would look like.
- At OCN London I regularly led teams of moderators when visiting clients. I was responsible for coordinating their efforts and ensuring that work was completed to extremely tight schedules in challenging and sometimes unfriendly environments.

#### Ambition

I am extremely ambitious, with an insatiable appetite to learn everything about everything. I feel like a kid in a sweet shop with all the technologies there are on my to-do list of things to look at next. I want to be excellent at everything I do. I want to be excellent at the full stack. I want to be respected as an expert in my field.

#### Determination and persistence

I don't know when or how to give up.

- During the final project at Maker's Academy, the group had huge difficulty working out how to test the WebSocket-based components of the code. We spent hours on it without success. I refused to give up, and finally managed to write a successful test on the morning of the last day of the project.
- I spent four years unable to work due to ill-health. Recovery was a long, difficult path with plenty of obstacles, but I never once thought that I would not be able to make it back to full-time employment.
