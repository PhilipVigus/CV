I am a driven, dedicated full-stack developer with a degree in Computer Science and a hunger to learn. I spent much of my early career working in education, initially as an ICT teacher before moving into quality assurance, where I worked with organisations across London to improve their educational provision.

I am looking for a change of direction and am returning to my roots in technology. I recently completed the bootcamp at Makers Academy to prepare myself for a career in software development. I love the blend of creative and analytical skills required, and seeing a website grow before my eyes really excites me.

### Non-technical

#### Communication

I excel with verbal and written communication, and am able to break complex concepts down into easy to digest chunks so they can be more easily discussed and understood.

- At Makers Academy I received regular positive feedback about the way I communicated during group projects and in pair programming. I am passionate about ensuring everyone gets a say in the direction a project takes, and take pride in my ability to facilitate this
- At OCN London I often had to communicate difficult feedback to clients while maintaining strong and constructive working relationships. I sat in rooms full of hostile teachers, explaining why the courses they had spent the last year delivering were so poor that their learners could not yet receive their certificates. I then had to work with the same staff to improve their provision and ensure learners were able to progress

#### Problem solving

I have a thorough, methodical approach to solving problems.

- At Makers Academy I was known for drilling down into an issue or bug rather than making a lot of changes without understanding what was and wasn't working. Isolating the specific line of code made it far quicker to identify the cause and find a solution
- When faced with something I don't understand or a problem I need to solve, I utilise thorough research skills. I spend time establishing whether someone else has already solved the same or a similar problem. If this is the case then I make sure I understand how they did so, rather than blindly copying their approach. I also emphasize the importance of official documentation, which often contains the answers I am looking for. If that fails then I will spend time reading around the subject, making sure my understanding of the issue and its context is strong. I break the problem down into the smallest possible chunks, which by itself can make a seemingly unsurmountable issue much simpler, and solve those micro-problems one at a time until there are none left

#### An excellent understanding of how learning works

This helps me to learn quickly, independently and effectively, and allows me to facilitate the learning of those around me.

- Before starting at Makers Academy I taught myself to build and deploy a full-stack project using Express, MongoDB and the PUG templating language. The result of this is my [Trailers](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/trailers-express) project
- At Makers Academy
  - I taught myself React alongside the regular curriculum areas
  - I was regularly given extremely positive feedback by team members and pair partners on how well I facilitated their learning without spoonfeeding them solutions
  - I mentored two members of a later cohort, helping them get the most out of the course by offering technical and pastoral advice and guidance based on my experience
- While recovering from ill-health I taught myself to compose and synthesize classical music

#### High emotional intelligence

I am extremely self-aware, and am able to empathize effectively with others. This helps in a wide variety of ways. At Makers Academy I was able to resolve a number of difficult situations while working in groups
- Towards the end of one project it became clear that there was a split in the group. One side was focused on getting as much done as possible, with one person adding a lot of code at the last minute that others did not understand. The other side was more interested in ensuring that the work represented the entire group. I identified this problem early, and helped the group reach a compromise that everyone was happy with
- It helps me give constructive, critical feedback when pair programming in a way that is non-threatening and helpful. I also quickly identify when I make mistakes or do things that inadvertently upset other people, and am very receptive to feedback on how to improve

#### Leadership

I have strong leadership skills.

- At Makers Academy I often took leadership roles during critical times in projects. I led our final project for the first couple of days, establishing solid foundations such as a team charter, consensus on the details of the project, and broadly what the two weeks of the project would look like. Every time I led I received unanimous positive feedback on my ability to keep groups focused and on task, ensure that all team members felt they had a voice, and help the team reach consensus when there were disagreements
- At OCN London I regularly led teams of moderators when visiting my clients. I was responsible for coordinating their efforts and ensuring that work was completed to extremely tight schedules in challenging and occasionally unfriendly environments

#### Determination and persistence

I don't know when or how to give up.

- During the final project at Makers Academy the group had huge difficulty working out how to test the WebSocket-based components of the code. We spent hours on it without success. I refused to give up, and finally managed to write a successful test on the morning of the last day of the project
- I spent 4 years unable to work due to ill health. Recovery was a long, difficult path with plenty of obstacles, but I never once thought that I would not be able to make it back to full time employment
