I am a driven, dedicated full-stack developer with a degree in Computer Science and a hunger to learn. I spent much of my early career working in education, initially as an ICT teacher before moving into quality assurance, where I worked with organisations across London to improve their educational provision.

I am looking for a change of direction and am returning to my roots in technology. I recently completed the bootcamp at Makers Academy to prepare myself for a career in software development. I love the blend of creative and analytical skills required, and seeing a website grow before my eyes really excites me.

### Non-technical

#### Communication

I excel with verbal and written communication, and am able to break complex concepts down into small chunks so they can be easily discussed and understood.

- At Makers Academy I received regular positive feedback about the way I communicated during group projects and in pair programming. I am passionate about ensuring everyone gets a say in the direction a project takes, and take pride in my ability to facilitate this.
- At OCN London I sometimes had to communicate difficult feedback to clients while maintaining strong and constructive working relationships. For example, explaining to hostile teachers why their courses were so poor that their learners could not yet receive their certificates. I then had to work with the same staff to improve their provision and ensure learners were able to progress.

#### Problem solving

I have a thorough, methodical approach to solving problems.

- At Makers Academy I was known for drilling down into an issue or bug, making minimal and incremental changes that I understood the impact of. This made it easier to identify the precise sections of code to focus on.
- When faced with something I don't understand, or a problem I need to solve, I utilise thorough research skills. I spend time establishing whether someone else has already solved the same or a similar problem. I check official documentation and read around the subject, making sure I fully understand the issue and its context. I then break the problem down into the smallest possible pieces and solve these micro-problems one at a time.

#### An excellent understanding of how learning works

This helps me to learn quickly, independently and effectively, and allows me to facilitate the learning of those around me.

- Before starting at Makers Academy I created a [Trailers](https://github.com/PhilipVigus/trailers-express) website, teaching myself to build and deploy a full stack project using Express, MongoDB and the PUG templating language.
- At Makers Academy
  - I taught myself React alongside the standard curriculum.
  - I was regularly given extremely positive feedback by team members and pair partners on how well I facilitated their learning without spoonfeeding them solutions.
  - I mentored two members of a later cohort, helping them get the most out of the course by offering technical and pastoral advice based on my experience.
- While recovering from ill-health I taught myself to compose and synthesize classical music.

#### High emotional intelligence

I am extremely self-aware, and am able to empathize effectively with others.
- At the end of one project at Makers Academy there was a split in the group. One side was focused on getting as much done as possible, with one person adding a lot of code that others did not understand. The other side was more interested in ensuring that the work represented the entire group. I identified this problem quickly, and helped the group reach a compromise that everyone was happy with.
- I give constructive, critical feedback when pair programming in a non-threatening and helpful way.
- I quickly identify when I make mistakes and am very receptive to feedback on how to improve.

#### Leadership

I have strong leadership skills.

- At Makers Academy I often took leadership roles during critical times and received unanimous positive feedback on my ability to keep groups on task, ensure that all team members had a voice, and help the team reach consensus when there were disagreements. I led our final project for the first couple of days, establishing solid foundations such as a team charter, consensus on the details of the project, and broadly what the two weeks of the project would look like.
- At OCN London I regularly led teams of moderators when visiting clients. I was responsible for coordinating their efforts and ensuring that work was completed to extremely tight schedules in challenging and sometimes unfriendly environments.

#### Determination and persistence

I don't know when or how to give up.

- During the final project at Makers Academy the group had huge difficulty working out how to test the WebSocket-based components of the code. We spent hours on it without success. I refused to give up, and finally managed to write a successful test on the morning of the last day of the project.
- I spent four years unable to work due to ill-health. Recovery was a long, difficult path with plenty of obstacles, but I never once thought that I would not be able to make it back to full-time employment.
